# 📊 Social Network Site (SNS) Data Analysis

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Social Network Site (SNS) dataset using Python and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧠 Objective

To understand user demographics and behavior based on available SNS user data. The analysis includes handling missing values, exploring age and gender distributions, and preparing data for future modeling.

## 📁 Files Included

- `sns_data_analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis
- `snsdata.csv` — Dataset file (uploaded only if it's public/non-confidential)
- `README.md` — This readme file

## 🔍 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## ✅ Key Analysis

- Handled unknown values like `'notknown'`, `'unknown'` and replaced them with `NaN`
- Visualized gender distribution using `value_counts()`
- Checked age distribution and other statistical metrics
- Inspected missing data to prepare for future ML pipelines
